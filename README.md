# CheapQuest

CheapQuest is a personal project in order to acquire more experience with Android Studio.
This a very classical RPG in which you have to fight ennemies to get XP, level up and fight stronger monsters.
The overall objective is to improve this game once it's finished with a CheapQuest 2 including more animations, sound, better effects...
